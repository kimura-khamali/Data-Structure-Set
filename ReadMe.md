# Data Structures


## Heaps:
Question: Explain the concept of a heap data structure, its types, and the time complexity of its main operations. How does heapify work?

~ Answer: ~
A heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property. 
It is a complete tree binary data structure which satisfy heap properties.

There are two types of heaps:

Max Heap: In a max heap, for any given node I, the value of I is greater than or equal to the values of its children.
Min Heap: In a min heap, the value of node I is less than or equal to the values of its children.

Heaps are commonly implemented as arrays, where for a node at index i:

* Its left child is at index 2i + 1
* Its right child is at index 2i + 2
* Its parent is at index (i-1) / 2

* * The main operations of a heap and their time complexities are:

* Insert: O(log n)
* Delete (extract min/max): O(log n)
* Get min/max: O(1)
* Heapify: O(n)
* Build Heap: O(n)

Heapify is the process of converting a binary tree into a heap. It works by starting from the bottom of the tree and moving upwards, comparing each node with its children and swapping if necessary to maintain the heap property. The process continues until the root is reached.
For building a heap, we start from the last non-leaf node (n/2 - 1, where n is the number of nodes) and perform heapify on each node moving upwards to the root. Although it might seem like O(n log n), it actually has a time complexity of O(n) due to the decreasing height of subtrees as we move up.
Heaps are particularly useful in implementing priority queues, heap sort, and in algorithms like Dijkstra's shortest path and Prim's minimum spanning tree.

# Tuples:
Question: What are tuples in Python? How do they differ from lists, and what are their advantages and disadvantages?

Answer:
Tuples in Python are immutable sequences, typically used to store collections of heterogeneous data. They are defined by enclosing the elements in parentheses ().
Key characteristics of tuples:

Immutability: Once created, tuples cannot be modified. This makes them useful for representing fixed collections of items.
Ordered: Like lists, tuples maintain the order of elements.
Indexing: Elements can be accessed using zero-based indexing.
Heterogeneous: Tuples can contain elements of different data types.

Differences from lists:

Syntax: Tuples use parentheses (), while lists use square brackets [].
Mutability: Tuples are immutable, lists are mutable.
Methods: Tuples have fewer built-in methods compared to lists due to their immutability.

Advantages of tuples:

Performance: Tuples are slightly faster than lists for accessing elements.
Memory efficiency: Tuples use less memory than lists.
Safety: Immutability prevents accidental modification of data.
Use as dictionary keys: Unlike lists, tuples can be used as dictionary keys.
Multiple return values: Functions can easily return multiple values using tuples.

Disadvantages of tuples:

Inflexibility: Once created, tuples cannot be modified, which can be limiting in some scenarios.
Fewer built-in methods: Due to immutability, tuples lack methods like append(), extend(), etc.

Tuples are particularly useful when you want to group related data that shouldn't change, such as coordinates, database records, or function return values containing multiple elements.

## Queues:
Question: Describe the queue data structure, its operations, and implementations. How does a priority queue differ from a standard queue?

Answer:
A queue is a linear data structure that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. It is an abstract data type with two main operations:

Enqueue: Add an element to the rear of the queue
Dequeue: Remove and return the element at the front of the queue

Other common operations include:
3. Front/Peek: View the front element without removing it
4. IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty
5. Size: Get the number of elements in the queue
Implementations of queues:



Stack-based implementation:

Uses two stacks to simulate a queue
Enqueue: O(1), Dequeue: Amortized O(1)
Less efficient in terms of space, but can be useful in certain scenarios



Binary Heap: Most common, offers O(log n) for insert and extract-min/max
Fibonacci Heap: Provides amortized O(1) for insert and decrease-key, O(log n) for extract-min
Binary Search Tree: Balanced trees like AVL or Red-Black trees can be used
Stacks:

## Stack
Answer:
A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. It is an abstract data type with two primary operations:

Push: Add an element to the top of the stack
Pop: Remove and return the element from the top of the stack

Other common operations include:
3. Peek/Top: View the top element without removing it
4. IsEmpty: Check if the stack is empty
5. Size: Get the number of elements in the stack
